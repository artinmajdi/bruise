			- **Regular Team Meetings:**
				- **Frequency:** Weekly or bi-weekly, depending on project phase.
				- **Agenda:** Structured agenda covering progress, roadblocks, next steps, and a dedicated time for Q&A or open discussion.
				- **Format:** Mix of full team meetings and smaller subgroup meetings (e.g., tech team, clinical advisory).
			- **Multiple Channels:**
				- **Project Management Tools:** (e.g., Asana, Trello, Jira) for task tracking and progress visibility.
				- **Shared Documentation:** (e.g., Confluence, Google Workspace, GitHub Wiki) for protocols, design documents, meeting minutes.
				- **Communication Platforms:** (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for quick queries and informal discussions.
				- **Email:** For formal communication and external correspondence.
			- **Tailored Communication:** Adapt your communication style to the audience. Explain technical concepts clearly to clinicians, and clinical needs clearly to engineers/programmers. Avoid jargon where possible or explain it.
			- **Active Listening:** Encourage team members to share their perspectives and listen attentively to understand their challenges and ideas.

			- **Role Clarity:** Clearly define roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each team member, especially for students and programmers you supervise.
			- **Delegation based on Strengths & Development Needs:** Assign tasks that leverage individual strengths while also providing opportunities for growth. For students, this is particularly important.

			- **Value Diverse Perspectives:** Actively solicit input from all team members. Recognize that clinicians bring invaluable real-world insights, and students may offer fresh perspectives.
			- **Psychological Safety:** Create an environment where team members feel safe to ask questions, admit mistakes, and propose unconventional ideas without fear of negative repercussions.

			- **Career Guidance (for students):** Offer advice on academic progress, research directions, and career paths.

			- **Regular Feedback Loops:** Not just top-down, but also solicit feedback on your own leadership and the team's processes.

		*Imagine a graduate student is tasked with improving the bruise segmentation model. My approach would be:*

		1.  **Initial Planning:**
			* Meet to clearly define the specific objective (e.g., "Improve Dice score for faint bruises on Fitzpatrick V-VI skin tones by 10% within 3 months").
			* Discuss potential approaches (e.g., new architectures, loss functions, data augmentation strategies).
			* Break down the task into manageable sub-tasks with timelines.
			* Ensure they have access to necessary resources (data, compute, relevant papers).

		2.  **Ongoing Support & Mentorship:**
			* **Weekly 1-on-1s:** Review progress, discuss experimental results, troubleshoot issues (e.g., code bugs, unexpected model behavior).
			* **Code Reviews:** Provide feedback on their code quality, efficiency, and documentation.
			* **Guidance on Research:** Help them interpret results, suggest next experiments, and guide them in literature review.
			* **Encourage Independence:** While providing support, encourage them to take initiative and problem-solve independently.

		3.  **Integration with Team:**
			* Ensure the student presents their progress and findings to the wider tech team periodically.
			* Facilitate discussions between the student and clinicians if their work requires specific domain input (e.g., "Are these segmented regions clinically plausible?").

		4.  **Professional Development:**
			* Encourage them to write up their findings for potential publication or conference presentation.
			* Help them develop presentation skills.
