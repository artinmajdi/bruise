		st.subheader("Algorithmic Approach Considerations")
		st.markdown("""
		Addressing this challenge requires a robust computer vision pipeline. Here are some key considerations:

		**1. Data Preprocessing & Augmentation:**
		- **Color Normalization/Standardization:** Account for variations in lighting and camera sensors, especially critical across different ALS wavelengths if multiple are used.
		- **Contrast Enhancement:** Techniques like CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) can be useful, particularly for low-contrast bruises.
		- **Data Augmentation:** Crucial due to likely limited datasets of bruises on diverse skin tones with ALS.
			- Geometric: Rotations, flips, scaling, elastic deformations.
			- Photometric: Brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments.
			- Synthetic Data: GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or other generative models could create realistic bruise images under various conditions, though this is complex. Consider synthetic bruise overlays on real skin images.

		**2. Model Architecture:**
		- **Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs):**
			- **U-Net and its variants (e.g., Attention U-Net, U-Net++):** Excellent for biomedical image segmentation due to their encoder-decoder structure and skip connections, which help preserve spatial information for precise localization.
			- **Vision Transformers (ViTs) or Hybrid Models (CNN+Transformer):** May offer benefits in capturing global context, but often require larger datasets or sophisticated pre-training.
		- **Multi-modal Fusion (if applicable):** If ALS provides multiple spectral bands or distinct images (e.g., white light + specific ALS wavelength), the model needs to effectively fuse this information. This could be early fusion (concatenate inputs), intermediate fusion, or late fusion (combine outputs of separate streams).

		**3. Loss Functions:**
		- **Dice Loss or Jaccard/IoU Loss:** Good for handling class imbalance common in segmentation (bruise pixels vs. background pixels).
		- **Focal Loss:** Addresses class imbalance by down-weighting well-classified examples, focusing on hard-to-classify pixels.
		- **Combined Loss:** E.g., Dice Loss + Binary Cross-Entropy for stability and good performance.

		**4. Handling Low Contrast and Noise:**
		- **Attention Mechanisms:** Self-attention or channel attention within the network can help focus on relevant features and suppress noise.
		- **Pre-training:** Using models pre-trained on large medical image datasets (if available and relevant) or even general image datasets (like ImageNet) can provide a good starting point.
		- **Regularization Techniques:** Dropout, Batch Normalization to prevent overfitting, especially with noisy data.

		**5. Postprocessing:**
		- **Morphological Operations:** Opening/closing to remove small spurious predictions or fill small holes in the segmented mask.
		- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):** Can be used to refine segmentation boundaries based on pixel similarities.

		**Practical Algorithmic Choices for EAS-ID:**
		- Start with a robust **Attention U-Net** architecture due to its proven success in medical imaging and ability to handle variations.
		- Implement a strong **data augmentation pipeline** specifically designed to simulate variations in skin tone, bruise appearance, and ALS effects.
		- Utilize a **combined Dice + BCE loss function** for training.
		- If multiple ALS wavelengths are used, explore **intermediate fusion techniques** within the U-Net architecture.
		- Emphasize **explainability techniques** (e.g., Grad-CAM) to understand what features the model uses, which is crucial for clinical validation and trust.
