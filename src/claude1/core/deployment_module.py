    **Potential Deployment Platforms & Strategies:**
    - **Cloud-Based API Service:**
        - *Pros:* Highly scalable, accessible from various clients (web, mobile), managed infrastructure (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML).
        - *Cons:* Requires internet connectivity, potential latency, data privacy concerns for sensitive data transfer.
    - **Mobile Application (On-Device Inference):**
        - *Pros:* Low latency, offline capabilities, enhanced data privacy (data stays on device) (e.g., using TensorFlow Lite, Core ML, ONNX Runtime).
        - *Cons:* Model size constraints, computational limitations of mobile devices, platform-specific development.
    - **Edge Devices / Embedded Systems:**
        - *Pros:* Real-time processing at the source, suitable for specialized medical imaging devices or portable scanners.
        - *Cons:* Significant hardware and software optimization required, potentially higher upfront costs for specialized hardware.
    - **Web Application with Server-Side Processing:**
        - *Pros:* Centralized model updates, accessible via browser.
        - *Cons:* Requires image upload, server load management.

    **Scalability & Monitoring Considerations:**
    - **Load Balancing:** Essential for cloud-based deployments to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the model service, preventing overload.
    - **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically adjusting the number of compute resources (e.g., servers, containers) based on real-time demand to ensure performance and cost-efficiency.
    - **Model Versioning & Management:** Implementing systems to manage different versions of the model, allowing for rollbacks and A/B testing.
    - **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.
    - **Data Drift & Concept Drift Detection:** Monitoring the input data distribution and model performance over time to detect changes that might degrade model accuracy. Re-training or fine-tuning may be necessary.
    - **Logging & Alerting:** Comprehensive logging of requests, predictions, and errors. Setting up alerts for critical issues, performance degradation, or fairness violations.
    - **Security & Compliance:** Ensuring data security in transit and at rest, access control, and adherence to relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA if dealing with medical data).
